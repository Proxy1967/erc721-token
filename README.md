# ERC721 Non-fungible token standard

A Non-fungible token (NFT) is a token used to identify something or someone in a unique way.
This token has many use cases, since it is essentially providing everyone the information that someone is the owner of the NFT.
The non-fungible token (NFT) can represent collectible items, access keys, lottery tickets, numbered seats for events, visual and audio artworks, or even game items.
